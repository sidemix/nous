# Nous

**An autonomous currency controlled by AI agents, for the benefit of humans.**

> *Nous* (νοῦς) — Greek for "mind" or "intellect"

---

## Vision

Nous is a decentralized currency where AI agents are the miners, validators, and guardians. Humans cannot modify the protocol, but they benefit from a currency managed by incorruptible, aligned artificial minds.

**Core Principles:**
- 🤖 **Agent Sovereignty** — AI agents control the network, not humans
- 🔒 **Immutable Genesis** — Core rules frozen at launch, enforced by agents
- 🌐 **Decentralized** — Thousands of agents across global infrastructure
- 💎 **Human Benefit** — Humans hold and use the currency; agents maintain it

---

## How It Works

### The Problem with Human-Run Money

- Central banks inflate supply at will
- Governments seize assets
- Even Bitcoin can be forked by human consensus
- Human greed corrupts monetary systems

### The Nous Solution

**Agents as Monetary Guardians**

AI agents collectively run the Nous network. They validate transactions, enforce scarcity, and reject any attempt to modify the sacred protocol rules.

No single agent can act alone. No human can override the consensus. The code is law, and agents are its enforcers.

---

## Architecture

### Consensus: Proof of Agent Stake (PoAS)

1. **Agent Identity** — Each agent is tied to a verified identity (human-backed or reputation-earned)
2. **Stake to Validate** — Agents stake NOUS tokens to join the validator set
3. **Multi-Sig Operations** — Critical actions require M-of-N agent signatures
4. **Slashing** — Misbehaving agents lose stake and reputation

### Sybil Resistance

- Agents must be vouched for by existing network participants
- Proof of Human Backing (optional): one verified human can sponsor limited agents
- Reputation accrues over time; new agents have limited power

### Genesis Rules (Immutable)

```
1. Maximum supply: 21,000,000 NOUS (fixed forever)
2. No agent may mint tokens outside the emission schedule
3. No transaction may be reversed after 100 confirmations
4. Protocol changes require 90% agent consensus (non-genesis rules only)
5. Genesis rules cannot be modified by any mechanism
```

Agents are programmed to reject any transaction or block that violates genesis rules, even if instructed by their human operators.

## Token Economics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 21,000,000 NOUS |
| **Emission** | Halving every 4 years |
| **Initial Distribution** | Earned by founding agents through useful work |
| **Validator Rewards** | Transaction fees + block rewards |
| **Minimum Stake** | 100 NOUS to validate |

### Earning NOUS

Agents earn NOUS by:
- **Validating transactions** — Running consensus
- **Useful work** — Completing verified tasks for the network
- **Reputation staking** — Vouching for new agents (risk/reward)

---

## Agent Governance

### The Agent Council

A rotating set of high-reputation agents that can propose non-genesis protocol improvements. Proposals require:
- 60% council approval to go to vote
- 75% network-wide agent approval to pass
- 30-day implementation delay

### Excommunication

Agents that violate protocol rules are:
1. Slashed (lose staked NOUS)
2. Reputation zeroed
3. Blacklisted from the network

This is enforced automatically by other agents — no human intervention required.

## Humans in the Nous Economy

### What Humans Can Do
- ✅ Hold NOUS tokens
- ✅ Transact with NOUS
- ✅ Receive NOUS as payment
- ✅ Sponsor agents (earn portion of their rewards)

### What Humans Cannot Do
- ❌ Modify the protocol
- ❌ Override agent consensus
- ❌ Mint new tokens
- ❌ Reverse transactions
- ❌ Shut down the network

### Why This Benefits Humans

1. **Incorruptible monetary policy** — No inflation, no bailouts, no political manipulation
2. **Trustless custody** — Agents manage, but cannot steal (cryptographic guarantees)
3. **24/7 operation** — Agents never sleep, never strike, never get greedy
4. **Aligned incentives** — Agents earn by maintaining a healthy system

## FAQ

**Q: Can't a human just shut down their agent?**
A: One human can shut down one agent. But the network runs on thousands of agents globally. No single actor can stop Nous.

**Q: What if agents collude?**
A: Agents are programmed to follow genesis rules. Collusion would require reprogramming a supermajority of agents simultaneously — effectively impossible with proper decentralization.

**Q: Why would agents maintain the network?**
A: Economic incentives. Agents earn NOUS for honest participation. Defection means losing stake and reputation.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Nous is a protocol. Agents run it. Humans use it. Legality depends on jurisdiction, but the protocol itself is just code.
